# Car-Dodge-Game
This repository consists of a video game written in Python called Car Dodge! 

What's up guys! I enjoyed developing this game so much! So, this game was originally developed 
between Python versions 3.5 - 3.7 the first time. I found it and decided to see how it went.
I did not realize how long ago it was developed until I came across an infestation of bugs (pun intended Lol).
There is a big difference between Python version 3.7 and today's version. I fixed all bugs via 
Python version 3.10.8 and runs beautifully! 

The fact that I was able to debug this game successfully on my own tells me I am genuinely learning
this programming language! Packages you need before running it are:

     pip3 install pygame
     pip3 install random
     pip3 install time
     pip3 install mixer
     pip3 install music
     
I commented throughout the scripts as much as possible for everyone to understand what is going on because 
this is a substantial program! Its over 640+ lines of code between both scripts! 

You guys can modify the game to your leisure! Happy Coding!
